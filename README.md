Usage
-----

Hide Quest Tracker provides slash commands to control its functionality:

*   /hqt on: Enables the addon, hiding the quest tracker.
*   /hqt off: Disables the addon, showing the quest tracker.
*   /hqt: Displays the current status and usage instructions.

 

By default, the addon is enabled when you first install it. You can use these commands to toggle the functionality as needed during your gameplay.

The addon will remember your preference across game sessions, so you only need to set it once unless you want to change it.
